# VaR using EVT approach with unknown shape parameter confidence interval width and threshold selection

Value at Risk (VaRα) is an important metric of quantitative financial risk, it measures the value that a portfolio might lose at its α-quantile worse scenario. In recent years, Extreme Value Theory started being applied to estimate this number. This approach is dependent on the choice of the threshold u that defines the starting point of the tail for the returns distribution. There are some heuristics to choosing this limit but a case-by-case study is still required for this analysis.
We propose an assessment of the confidence interval of the VaRα estimator by propagating the uncertainty of the shape parameter ξ from the tail distribution, approximated by a Generalized Pareto Distribution. The results show that choosing the threshold such that the proportion of points beyond is the complement of the level α is optimal when enough points are available. Otherwise, we find empirical evidence of a log-linear relationship between the width of the confidence interval of VaRα with unknown ξ and the proportion of points above the threshold.
